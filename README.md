# Client Work Schedule

## Description

- I love making schedules because of the easy to use Library dayjs. It offers a simple process to log information without having to do the math for it all.
- I chose to create a work schedule because I wanted a user-friendly and intuitive, schedule that allows users to easily add and delete tasks as needed.
- I desided to create a work schedule because it displays my skill and use of dayjs along with Jquery with local storage.
- By making this page, I learned about Dayjs useability and dynamic adjusting to transition between dates and times.
